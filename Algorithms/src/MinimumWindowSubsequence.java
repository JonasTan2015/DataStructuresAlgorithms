/**
 * Given strings S and T, find the minimum (contiguous) substring W of S, so that T is a subsequence of W.

 If there is no such window in S that covers all characters in T, return the empty string "". If there are multiple such minimum-length windows, return the one with the left-most starting index.

 Example 1:

 Input:
 S = "abcdebdde", T = "bde"
 Output: "bcde"
 Explanation:
 "bcde" is the answer because it occurs before "bdde" which has the same length.
 "deb" is not a smaller window because the elements of T in the window must occur in order.
