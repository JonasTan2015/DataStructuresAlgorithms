Why pocket gems?
My very good friend, Leigh is working in Pocket Gems. From the his description about Pocket Gems, I am totally facinated. Pocket Gems is always filled with energy. Engineers may work in robust teams and devote themselves for provide better gaming experience.

Why I value team energy so much? I have worked in some other companies before. They stick to their old solutions. And in such a company, I do not have much space to build my career. And Pocket Gems is always inviting new things. That is what I am looking for. 


Why are you a strong candidate?
First of all, I have development experience before. In Boston, I am working in Philips, under data science team. One of the best project in Philips is that web platform for machine learning and big data. On that platform, Philips may apply their ideas in minutes, share their ideas across the companies and test it immediately.

Pocket Gems might not build such a platform. But you need someone with experience, open to new technologies and passion for software experience. I can provide all of the above.
